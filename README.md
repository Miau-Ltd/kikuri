## 1. Introduction

Kikuri is an up-to-date private WIP multi-purpose discord bot created mainly using the framework Sapphire, it's a planned extension off my personal bot Abigail Williams based of the old Discord-akairo and Discord.js v12 libraries. A lot of the features will be made up to date as well as a lot of the commands that were implemented before will be scrapped as they were based on what I required in the past.

## 2. Features

This bot is primarily focused on fulfilling any personal gripes I have that I would like to have within a bot as well as: moderation, game searching, deals & data (Rivals, League, Granblue Fantasy, etc), google sheets automation, twitch & youtube notifications, exp & economy and much more.

As the bot is in very early stage listing a ton of upcoming features will be put on hold as command implementations begin being put in.

## 3. Developing

### Requirements

- `node.js`: To run the project.
- `typescript`: To code and compile the project.

## 5. Contributing

You're free to contribute towards the bot if you would like to make any additions, if you have any questions contact my discord: 4miau.

A guide will be made in-depth detail however here is a simple guide.

Feel free to create a new fork/clone the repository and submit a pull request with a description explaining what the addition/purpose of the addition is. I'd personally suggest using a Linter & Prettier.

1. Fork, clone & select the main branch
2. Create a new branch in your fork
3. Add to the project
4. Commit your changes and push
5. Submit a pull request

## 6. Author

Hey, I'm miau! I just create things for fun with my silly little coding. You can always contact my discord at 4miau or you may also send me an email at [4miau@pm.me](mailto:4miau@pm.me)

## 7. Notes

This is essentially a personal project, but being provided and serviced to the public. I am not a massively experienced coder in terms of producing production code onto GitHub so I appreciate any contributions anyone feels like making. I just love to chill and do my own thing.
